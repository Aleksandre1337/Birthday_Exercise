# Birthday_Exercise
The code simulates the birthday problem. Right now the code simulates a room with only 2 people that get random birthdays, and the probability that those 2 people have the same birthday is really low.

Change the number 2 to a higher number of your choosing where it says #Change This Number and run the code.

Is there a match in the simulation? Whatâ€™s the probability that there would be a match?

Keep changing the number to test out different simulations.
